# System v2
This prototype tests the main steps in the Raspberry Pi 4. Ensure that the speaker and microphone are plugged in BEFORE the RP4 turns on so it is active. You can double check this with Audacity. This program has the user select the test tone. The start tone will play and the test tone will play 2 seconds later. As soon as the test tone is played, the microphone will be recording. The recording will be saved as received.wav. If the received and test arrays are not the same length, the arrays will be concatenated to ensure the length is the same. The filter will be generated with the equation h(t) = L^-1{Y(w)/X(w)} with y(t) = test tone and x(t) = received tone. The coefficients, as of this version, are only printed. They are then stored in a deque to be compared with next iterations of coefficients. If the average element-wise percent error is above the threshold, the system repeats. If it is within the threshold, the loop stops and the filter generation is complete.
